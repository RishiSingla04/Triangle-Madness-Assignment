# Triangle-Madness-Assignment

This was a grade 12 assignment where we were given the task to write a program which lets a user build a triangle with only 3 given inputs. These inputs could be 1 side and 2 angles, 2 sides and 1 angle or only 3 sides. The program was designed to create the rest of the triangle with the given specification and through the use of trigonometry. The program then gave the user a list of options such as outputting the specification of the triangle, the area of the triangle, the perimeter, or the option to change one of the sides. Based on the option the user chose, the specified output would be made and the user will be able to exit the code whenever they like. 

How to use the program:
- Download both files
- Launch an IDE and upload both files to the IDE
- Click run and the program should work as designed
